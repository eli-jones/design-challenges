## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Javascript

### Continued development

Something I struggled with was the JS validation. It has been a few months since I've really ever thought about JS, and while I review the Codecademy lesson on HTML Form Validation, it didn't really touch on the things I needed it to for this project. I've done my best and heavily referenced Programming's Fun video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yag59U7ESRE) on this project. I tried a handful of ways to get the placeholder text for the email input field to change when the input is invalid,  but I wasn't able to get it work correctly. I think I'll come back to this after a bit more practice to try it again.
