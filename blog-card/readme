## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS keyframe animations
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I took this as a chance to try out animations on load, which I'm pretty happy with.

### Continued development

I'm really happy with how this one came out! Because the challenge only includes the single card, I didn't design the card to work if there were more. I think this is fine for now, but if ever wanted to come back to this, I would make sure that it would duplicate well.
